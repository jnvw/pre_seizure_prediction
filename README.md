# pre_seizure_prediction
This project aims to predict seizures in epilepsy patients before they occur using machine learning techniques. By leveraging ensemble learning methods that combine multiple classification models, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions, providing valuable insights for patients and healthcare professionals.
